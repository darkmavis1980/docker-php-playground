# PHP Playground

Simple PHP7.2 with Apache 2 docker container to play with PHP

## With Docker

Build it with:

```
docker build .
// or with tag
docker build -t <username>/php-playground .
```

Run it with:

```
docker run -p 8300:80 php-playground
```

## With Docker Compose

Build it first with `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up`.
If you run with docker compose, you can do live editing of the files.

Everything is served from the `web` folder.

In either way you choose, the content will be visible at the address `http://localhost:8300`


## phpMyAdmin

The docker-compose.yml file also contains a container with MySQL and phpMyAdmin, and the latter one runs on the port `8799`, so you can access to it at the address
`http://localhost:8799/`


## Xdebug

To enable the Xdebug, please save the marklets you can find from [the Jetbrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/marklets/).
This docker container runs **Xdebug 2.6.0**.
